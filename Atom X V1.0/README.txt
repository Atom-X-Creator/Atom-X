This is a simple tutorial on how to use Atom X.

Step 1: Open 1v1.LOL.

Step 2: Run Atom X To Get The GUI

Step 3: Press Inject On The Gui

Step 4: Have fun using Atom X!




PS: You must use steamdb, revert to il2cpp version of 1v1.lol

then Atom X will work. But note that using anything other than the visuals and changing circle size,

will probably crash the game. So it's recommended that you only use those for protection from getting banned.

After almost every game it will crash because you are connecting to players on the current version,

while you are on an outdated verison. If this happens, don't freak out, simply relaunch the game, and reinject.

If your PC gives you a false positive and detects this as a virus, no worries, this is a legit program. 

What you see is what you get. Simple fix if it gets deleted, just turn your anti virus off, and redownload it/restore it.

I know it sounds really sketchy to say to turn it off, but I had to do it myself to use my own program. 

Stay safe, use at your own risk, and have fun!
